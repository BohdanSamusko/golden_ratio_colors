# Golden ratio colors - it is an app that generates random colors based on the golden ratio algorithm

This app generates colors according to the HSV Color model. 

Saturation and Value parameters are constants whose values depend on whether the Light or Dark theme is used. 

`Note:` Currently the app supports only the Light theme. 

Hue is calculated based on the golden ratio algorithm.

As a result, the app provides users with random colors suitable for use as a background for different labels and texts that remain visible and clearly readable.
